## Overview

Welcome to the **Cursor History MCP** repository! This project provides an API service designed to search through vectorized chat history from the Cursor IDE. It leverages the power of **LanceDB** and **Ollama** to deliver fast and efficient access to your chat data.

### Features

- **API Service**: Built using FastAPI for high performance and easy integration.
- **Vectorized Search**: Utilizes embeddings to enhance search capabilities.
- **Self-Hosted**: You can run this service locally or on your own server.
- **Docker Support**: Easy to deploy with Docker.
- **Integration with Ollama**: Access local LLM models for advanced processing.
